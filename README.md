# Reproducible Spatial Transcriptomics Pipeline with RSE Best Practices

<!-- A brief description of your exemplar, which may include an image -->
## Introduction

This exemplar details an analysis pipeline for spatial transcriptomics (10X Xenium platform).

### Spatial transcriptomics

<!-- TODO: Add description of what ST is -->

Below is representative image of spatial transcriptomics data.

### Spatial transcriptomics analysis pipeline

The pipeline covers preprocessing, quality control, dimensionality reduction, clustering, annotation, viewing spatial images, and spatial statistics (squidpy and MuSpAn).

Cell segmentation is *not* included in this pipeline as it is performed prior to the analysis using the 10X Genomics Xenium software. If you would like to segment the cells yourself, please refer to the [10X Genomics Nucleus and Cell Segmentation Algorithms](https://www.10xgenomics.com/support/software/xenium-onboard-analysis/latest/algorithms-overview/segmentation) for more information.

### Best Practices for Software Engineering

In addition to the analysis pipeline, we highlight several good software engineering practices including version control, containarization, linting, and continuous integration. Details on these practices and how to implement them can be found in the [Best Practices for Software Engineering](docs/3_RSE_best_practices.md) section of the documentation.

<!-- Quick Start Guide. Tell learners how to engage with the exemplar. -->
## Getting Started 🚀

1. Start by cloning the repository to your local machine in the directory of your choice

      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/ReCoDe-spatial-transcriptomics.git
      ```

2. Download the [Xenium Lung FFPE data](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/ffpe-human-lung-cancer-data-with-human-immuno-oncology-profiling-panel-and-custom-add-on-1-standard)

      - Data can be downloaded from the 10x Genomics website, or directly from the command line.
         - If downloading from the website, download the `Xenium_V1_Human_Lung_Cancer_Addon_FFPE_outs.zip` file.
         - If downloading from the command line, use the following command:

         ```bash
         curl -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/xenium/2.0.0/Xenium_V1_Human_Lung_Cancer_Addon_FFPE/Xenium_V1_Human_Lung_Cancer_Addon_FFPE_outs.zip
         ```

      - Unzip the downloaded file.
      - If you downloaded the file from the website, unzip it using your preferred method.
      - If you downloaded the file from the command line, use the following command:

         ```bash
         unzip Xenium_V1_Human_Lung_Cancer_Addon_FFPE_outs.zip
         ```

3. Create new virtual environment using `conda` or `venv`
Full details on how to set up the environment and install necessary packages can be found in the [Installation Guide](docs/1_installation.md).

      If you are using `venv`, run the following command:

      ```bash
      cd ReCoDe-spatial-transcriptomics # Ensure you are in the root directory of the repo
      python -m venv recode_st # create a new virtual environment named recode_st
      source recode_st/bin/activate  # On Windows use: st_env\Scripts\activate
      pip install -r requirements.txt # Install required packages
      pip install -e .  # Install the package in editable mode to install the st_recode package as defined by pyproject.toml
      ```

      If you are using `conda`, run the following command:

      ```bash
      cd ReCoDe-spatial-transcriptomics # Ensure you are in the root directory of the repo
      conda env create -f environment.yml
      conda activate recode_st
      pip install --no-build-isolation --no-deps -e .
      pip install https://docs.muspan.co.uk/code/latest.zip # If you need the MuSpAn modules
      ```

      Newest versions for some packages do not support older Macs with Intel CPUs, so we recommend using the `conda` environment for these systems. If you are using an Apple Silicon Mac, you can use either `conda` or `venv`.

4. Update the `config.toml` file with the relevant paths and parameters for your analysis. This file contains configuration settings for the analysis pipeline, such as paths to data files and parameters for various steps in the pipeline.

      Additional details can be found in the [Configuration Management](docs/2_configuration.md) section of the documentation.

5. Run the analysis pipeline by executing the main script.

      ```bash
      python -m recode_st config.toml
      ```

## Roadmap 🗺️

### Preprocessing & Quality Control

Goal: Ensure clean, usable spatial gene expression data.

It is critical to preprocess and perform quality control on the data before proceeding with analysis. This step ensures that the data is clean, usable, and of high quality by removing low quality cells and low quality transcripts.

Steps:

- Calculate quality metrics
- Filter low-quality genes and cells
- Normalize and transform gene counts

### Dimensionality Reduction & Clustering

Goal: Identify patterns and groups of similar gene expression profiles.

Dimensionality Reduction a technique used to reduce the number of features (or dimensions) in a dataset while preserving important information. Clustering is a technique used to group similar data points together based on their features. It is critical to determine the most accurate number of clusters to ensure that the clusters are meaningful and representative of the data.

Steps:

- Compute PCA and neighbors
- Compute and plot UMAP
- Cluster cells using Leiden algorithms
- Visualize clusters on UMAP

### Annotation & Cell Type Identification

Goal: Assign biological meaning to clusters.

Annotation is the process of assigning biological meaning to clusters. This typically equates to assigning a cell type identification to each clusters. is the process of identifying the cell types present in the data. Choosing the number of clusters can be challenging and can be seen as more of an art than a science. It is important to choose the number of clusters that best represents the data and the biological question being asked. More information on how to choose the number of clusters can be found in the [scRNAseq best practices](https://www.sc-best-practices.org/cellular_structure/clustering.html).

Steps:

- Compute differentially expressed genes for each cluster
- Visualize cluster marker genes
- Identify cell types with marker genes
- Annotate clusters with known cell types

### Spatial Mapping & Visualization

Goal: Map gene expression and clusters back to their spatial context.

- Overlay expression and clusters on tissue image
- Plot spatially enriched genes
- Map cell types or states in space

### Spatial Statistics & Spatially Variable Genes

Goal: Quantify spatial patterns and variability utilizing spatial statistics.

We use two different approaches to spatial statistics: Squidpy and MuSpAn.

#### Squidpy

- Construct spatial networks
- Spatial autocorrelation (e.g. Moran's I)
- Neighborhood Enrichment

#### MuSpAn

- Construct spatial networks
- Cross-PCF pairwise comparison

There are several additional spatial statistics methods available in MuSpAn, including:

- wPCF pairwise comparison
- Spatial autocorrelation (Hotspot Analysis)
- Ripley's K
- Neighborhood Enrichment
- Community detection
- Network filteration
- Comparing Networks

### Further analysis

We have included several potential downstream analysis methods in this pipeline to discover meaningful biological insights. Below are additional analysis approaches one could use to build on the methods mentioned above.

- DE between regions or conditions
- Pathway analysis (e.g. GSEA, ORA)
- Spatially variable genes (e.g `SpatialDE`)
- Drug-to-cell interactions (e.g`Drug2Cell`)
- Ligand-receptor interactions (e.g `SOAPy`)

and more...
